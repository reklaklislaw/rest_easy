    The Europeana Foundation is the operator of the Europeana service, including
    the search portal at Europeana.eu and related data services such as the 
    Europeana Application Programming Interface (API) and the Linked Open Data 
    pilot. The Foundation is governed by an Executive Committee and Board, and 
    employs full-time and part-time staff.
    
    The Europeana Network is an open, expert forum comprising content holders 
    and aggregators along with providers of technical, legal and strategic 
    knowledge.
    
    Our services are under constant development by content and technology 
    projects, collectively referred to as the Europeana project group.
